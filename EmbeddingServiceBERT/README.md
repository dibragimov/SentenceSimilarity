# bert-as-service

The service uses BERT model as a sentence encoding service, i.e. mapping a variable-length sentence to a fixed-length vector.
The goal is to represent a variable length sentence into a fixed length vector, e.g. hello world to [0.1, 0.3, 0.9]. 
Each element of the vector should "encode" some semantics of the original sentence.

Service uses BERT - an NLP model developed by Google for pre-training language representations. It leverages an enormous amount of plain text data publicly available on the web and is trained in an unsupervised manner. Pre-training a BERT model is a an expensive, one-time procedure for each language. Google released several pre-trained models where you can download from https://github.com/google-research/bert#pre-trained-models.

## Installation

The actial server and client can be installed via pip. They can be installed separately or even on different machines:

pip install bert-serving-server  # server
pip install bert-serving-client  # client, independent of `bert-serving-server`

* using ports 7001 and 7002 for port-in and port-out communications


## Dependencies
* Python >= 3.5
* Tensorflow >= 1.10

## Starting server

1. Download a Pre-trained BERT Model

Download a model, then uncompress the zip file into some folder, say /tmp/english_L-12_H-768_A-12/

2. Start the BERT service

After installing the server, you should be able to use bert-serving-start CLI as follows:

bert-serving-start -model_dir /tmp/english_L-12_H-768_A-12/
